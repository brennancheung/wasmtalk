# WasmTalk

## Long term vision

The long term vision for this repo is to create something akin to SmallTalk but
with WebAssembly.

Desired features:

* WebAssembly modules compiled directly from the UI in the UI
* Able to browse through code of modules
* Able to save modules and have them loaded in an "image"
* Manipulate the UI from within the UI itself

## Short term goals

* Experiment with WebAssembly from the ground up to gain expertise.
* Compile the bytes of a `.wasm` `ArrayBuffer` directly within UI.
* Implement MVP compiler to create `add` function.
* Create Jest tests to make development faster.
